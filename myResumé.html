    <h1>Martin Louw</h1>
        <p>I finished my matric in 2013 at Centurion High School, after which I was accepted in 2014 at the University of Pretoria to study towards a Bachelor of Commerce: Financial Science.  At the end of my second year, I realized that my passion was not Accounting.  I changed my study field to Bachelor of Commerce: Informatics.  I took a gap year in 2019 to become a better and more engaged student and obtained my Bachelor of Commerce: Informatics qualification in November 2020, the graduation ceremony took place in May 2021.</p>
        <p>I am able to work independently, or as part of a team.  I am a hard worker and take responsibility for the tasks assigned to me.</p>
